top down 2d game

futuristic shooter, or just ancient guy running around with a bow


side scroll 2d game
would utilize physics a lot, also shooter


completely text based game
shooting is not so fun in txt, so not much beyond rudimentary. but lots of other gmae interactions
may become easier due to auto pathing and more instant dialogues


first person game

beautiful doom style retro 2.5d art

s
third person game

i dont really like this genres

top down strategy games
mixed with city builder, dwarf fortress colony, rimworld, grand strategy victoria 2,

commonality: same map, same stats, all of them use interslavic

xy f64 position


all different renders for same underlying game. bad because would really require
just a heightgraph terrain,
 but each render can have its own tradeoff?s
